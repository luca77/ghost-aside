# Aside

A theme for [Ghost](http://github.com/tryghost/ghost/) based on the default theme, Casper. Most of the job has been done
by [Xander Dumaine](http://blog.xdumaine.com). The original repository is [here](https://github.com/xdumaine/ghost-aside).

For a demo, see it up and running on [my blog](http://while2.ghost.io).

## Important Notes

Make sure you de-comment the Google Analytics section and change Disqus keys before using this on your site.

## Roadmap / Future Developments

- Change the dark background of blog title (if it's acceptable on PC, it really sucks on mobile phones)

- Find a way to add related posts (or, at least, re-enable the previous/next links, as in the original Casper theme)

- Add a search box (the position has TBD)
